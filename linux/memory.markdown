how to `top` and sort by memory


Use quick tip using top command in linux/unix

top
hit `Shift + f`, then choose the display to order by memory usage by hitting key n then press Enter. You will see active process ordered by memory usage.

Or you can just press `M` after running the top command.

On OS X 10.10 the command `top -o MEM` seems to work.
