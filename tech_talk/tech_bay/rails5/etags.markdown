### Rails 5 switches from strong etags to weak etags

ETag, short for entity tag, is a part of HTTP header and is used for web cache validation. ETag is a digest of the resource that uniquely identifies specific version of the resource. This helps browser and web servers determine if resource in the browser’s cache is exactly same as the resource on the server.

Strong v/s Weak ETags

ETag supports [strong and weak validation](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616#section-13.3.3 ) of the resource.

Strong ETag indicates that resource content is same for response body and the response headers.

Weak ETag indicates that the two representations are semantically equivalent. It compares only the response body.

Weak ETags are [prefixed with](https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/a61bf5f5b63780a3e0b4c2d4339967df82b370de/actionpack/lib/action_dispatch/http/cache.rb#L91-L94) W\ and thus one can easily distinguish between Weak ETags and Strong ETags.

```
"543b39c23d8d34c232b457297d38ad99"    – Strong ETag
W/"543b39c23d8d34c232b457297d38ad99"  – Weak ETag
```

W3 has an example page to illustrate how ETag matching works.

When server receives a request, it returns an ETag header as part of HTTP response. This ETag represents state of the resource. For the subsequent HTTP requests, client sends this ETag via If-None-Match header to identify if the resource is changed or not. The server will compare the current ETag and the one sent by the client. If ETag matches, server responds with 304 Not modified. This means resource content in the client’s cache is uptodate. If resource is changed, server will send updated resource along with the new ETag.

Let’s see it in action.


### ETags in Rails 4.x


![how-etags-work](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/83296/15085097/1a90c3fe-13a6-11e6-9616-6fb658719f32.png)

```ruby
header[‘Etag’] = Digest::MD5.hexdigest(body)

# instead of
headers['Etag'] = Digest::MD5.hexdigest(@item.cache_key)
```


Rails 4.x generates strong ETags by default i.e without W/ prefix.

```ruby
class ItemsController < ApplicationController
  def show
    @item = Item.find(params[:id])
    fresh_when @item
  end
end
```
We are making first request to the server.

```

$ curl -i http://localhost:3000/items/1

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN
X-Xss-Protection: 1; mode=block
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
Etag: "618bbc92e2d35ea1945008b42799b0e7"
Last-Modified: Sat, 30 Jan 2016 08:02:12 GMT
Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8
Cache-Control: max-age=0, private, must-revalidate
X-Request-Id: 98359119-14ae-4e4e-8174-708abbc3fd4b

Date: Fri, 04 Mar 2016 10:50:38 GMT
Content-Length: 1014
Connection: Keep-Alive

```

For the next request, we will send ETag that was sent by the sever. And notice that server returns `304 Not Modified`.

```
$ curl -i -H 'If-None-Match: "618bbc92e2d35ea1945008b42799b0e7"' http://localhost:3000/items/1

HTTP/1.1 304 Not Modified

Date: Fri, 04 Mar 2016 10:51:22 GMT
Connection: Keep-Alive
```


### Rails 5 sets Weak ETags by default

In Rails 5, all ETags generated by Rails will be weak by default.


```
$ curl -i http://localhost:3000/items/1

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN
X-Xss-Protection: 1; mode=block
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
Etag: W/"b749c4dd1b20885128f9d9a1a8ba70b6"
Last-Modified: Sat, 05 Mar 2016 00:00:00 GMT
Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8
Cache-Control: max-age=0, private, must-revalidate
X-Request-Id: a24b986c-74f0-4e23-9b1d-0b52cb3ef906
X-Runtime: 0.038372
Server: WEBrick/1.3.1 (Ruby/2.2.3/2015-08-18)
Date: Fri, 04 Mar 2016 10:48:35 GMT
Content-Length: 1906
Connection: Keep-Alive

```


Now for the second request, server will return 304 Not Modified response as before, but the ETag is weak ETag.


```
$ curl -i -H 'If-None-Match: W/"b749c4dd1b20885128f9d9a1a8ba70b6"' http://localhost:3000/items/1

HTTP/1.1 304 Not Modified
X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN
X-Xss-Protection: 1; mode=block
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
Etag: W/"b749c4dd1b20885128f9d9a1a8ba70b6"
Last-Modified: Sat, 05 Mar 2016 00:00:00 GMT
Cache-Control: max-age=0, private, must-revalidate
X-Request-Id: 7fc8a8b9-c7ff-4600-bf9b-c847201973cc
X-Runtime: 0.005469
Server: WEBrick/1.3.1 (Ruby/2.2.3/2015-08-18)
Date: Fri, 04 Mar 2016 10:49:27 GMT
Connection: Keep-Alive
```




### Why this change?

Rails does not perform strong validation of ETags as implied by strong ETags spec. Rails just checks whether the incoming ETag from the request headers matches with the ETag of the generated response. It does not do byte by byte comparison of the response.

```ruby
class ProfilesController < ApplicationController
    etag { current_user.id }
    def show
      @profile = Profile.find(params[:id])
      fresh_when(@profile)
    end

    def edit
      @profile = Profile.find(params[:id])
      fresh_when(@profile)
    end 
  end
```  



This was true even before Rails 5. So this change is more of a course correction. Rack also [generates weak ETags](https://github.com/rack/rack/issues/681) by default because of similar reasons.

Mark Notthingham is chair of HTTP Working Group and he has [written about etags](https://www.mnot.net/blog/2007/08/07/etags) which has some useful links to other ETag resources.

Etag - is an object digest. It is set with fresh_when etag: @user rails helper, and adds header ETag:"0f842cb67189f534601db515e0ca5b55" to the response. If we make a request to the same URL twice and the etags are identical, the client will get "304 Not Modified".

Last-Modified - indicates the most recent modification date of an object. E.g. Rails statement fresh_when last_modified: @users.max(:updated_at) adds header Last-Modified:Tue, 20 May 2014 19:59:38 GMT to the response. If Last-Modified value of a request is the same as value of Last-Modified produced in your controller action, the client will get "304 Not Modified".

Important: If the Cache-Control header is set to public, and the Age value is less than max-age, the browser won't hit the Rails server, and will instead use its local cache, or cache located on the Varnish server. The presence of Etagand/or Last-Modified headers could cause server hits, but "304 - Not modified" will be returned if these values are identical to the values produced in your controller actions.
