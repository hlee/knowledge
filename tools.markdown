### map your key

In the config on Linux (server), in the section: screens in the definition for the mac (client)

I simply mapped all keys to command: 

```ruby

alt = super 
ctrl = super
super = super

```

only change clinet

if your client is pc and server is mac

```ruby

ctrl = ctrl
super = ctrl

```

just map both to ctrl
